				<br>
				For those experiments that involve pairing samples on the same
				array/chip/assay, click on "dual channel". Otherwise select "single
				channel".<br>
				<br>
				For example, if you are going to perform a one-color gene expression
				microarray experiment (e.g., using Affymetrix genechips), click on
				"single channel", while if you are going to perform a two color
				microarray experiment (e.g., on a two-color Agilent microarray),
				select "dual channel". <br>
				<br>
				The algorithm provided here is not restricted to designing
				microarray experiments and it can be applied to any type of
				genetical genomics studies with multiple conditions.</div>

				Corresponding individual and marker names can also be included as
				column and row names enclosed in quotation marks. Each cell contains
				a genotype label (e.g. A or B for the parental alleles, H for
				heterozygous loci; NA for missing data). <br/>An example of the file
				format is shown in the figure on the webpage and also in the linked

				<div><b> Specify the number of environmental factors. </b><br>
				<br>
				DesignGG now supports up to three factors. It should be noted that
				each factor must have at least two levels.<br>
				The levels of each factor can be quantitative (e.g., different
				temperatures) or qualitative (e.g., different tissue types), but
				never duplicated within the same factor. When there is no
				environmental factor,this tool provides an optimal design based on
				the distant pair algorithm <a href="references.html"
					style="text-decoration: none;">[13]</a>. Because of computational
				constraints, at most 10 levels can be specified per factor. <br>
				<br>
				As advanced option, alternative weights can be given to genetic and
				environmental factors. Therefore the full model is shown and decimal
				numbers can be used to change the weights of individual terms (or
				interaction terms). Details can be found at <a href="parameters.html">explanation of designGG parameters</a>.</div>

				The number of slides should be equal to or larger than the total
				number of conditions. Alternatively, the number of strains per
				condition should be larger than 1.<br>
				<br>
				Because of computational constraints, no more than 100 arrays per
				condition (or 10<sup>5</sup> arrays in total) can be used.</div>
