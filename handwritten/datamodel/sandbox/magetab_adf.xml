		<description> This package models Array Design Format (ADF) - defining
			each array type used. An ADF file describes the design of an array,
			e.g., what sequence is located at each position on an array and what
			the annotation of this sequence is. If the investigation uses arrays
			for which a description has been previously provided, such as a
			standard commercial array, cross-references to entries in a public
			repository (e.g., an ArrayExpress accession number) can be included
			instead of explicit array descriptions.</description>

			<description>
				Artificial class for modeling purposes. Acts as the generalization
				of any property of an ArrayDesign such as Reporter and Feature. The
				Nearest FuGE equivalent is DimensionElement but an Array specific
				extension was needed.
				<br />
				There is no direct equivalent of DesignElement in FuGE.

			<description>
				The ArrayDesign is used to represent the information about e.g. a
				microarray. The attributes are required to fulfill the MIAME
				conditions regarding surface type, polymer type etc and an
				association to ProtocolApplication is used to describe the details
				of Array production typically for self made rather than commercial
				arrays. The ArrayDesign is a high level object. ArrayDesign has
				associations to Features, Reporters and CompositeElements
				(previously called CompositeSequences in MAGE-OM 1.0) which describe
				layout of the ArrayDesign. ArrayDesign is only required for Array
				based experiments which use a traditional type microarray where
				layout and relationships of probes are important to detect layout
				effects.
				<br />
				There is no direct equivalent of ArrayDesign in FuGE, Protocol
				and/or Equipment is likely the nearest map as an Array specific
				extension was needed.

				it conflicts with the "Name" field in Identifiable. We are using

			<description>
				Feature represents the location of some material deposited at a
				specific place on an array. Feature has coordinates - BlockColumn,
				BlockRow, Column, Row. This concept is described in ArrayExpress
				documentation
				<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miamexpress/help/adf/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miamexpress/help /adf/</a>
				and an example of a correctly formatted ADF can be seen in the
				MAGE-TAB specification v1.0 document. See MAGE-TAB specification for
				detailed examples.

			<description>Reporter represents biological information about what

			<description>CompositeElement is used to facilitate cases where many

				different exons and the many-to-many relationships can be used to
				encode this. For simple 1:1 Feature-Reporter cases CompositeElement
				is not needed. See the MAGE-TAB specification for detailed examples.
