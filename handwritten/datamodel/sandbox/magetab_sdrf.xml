			This package models MAGE-TAB Sample and Data Relationship Format
			(SDRF) - a tab-delimited file (or files) describing the relationships
			between samples, arrays, data, and other objects used or produced in
			the investigation, and providing all MIAME information that is not
			provided elsewhere. This is often the least trivial part of the
			experiment description due to the typically large graph of complex
			relationships which are possible between samples and their respective
			hybridizations; however, for simple experimental designs,
			constructing the SDRF file is straightforward, and even complex loop
			designs can be expressed in this format.
			<br />
			To make this graph explicit, all relationships are modelled as Nodes
			and Edges, with the Nodes being tangible elements of the experiment
			like Material or Data files, and the Edges to represent the
			treatments that produced them. These edges can be annotated with
			zero-or-more Protocol Applications. This grouping of Protocol
			Applications is expected to make experiment modeling more flexible
			than FuGE.

			entity name="Edge" extends=""> <description> An Edge is a generic
			object that is used to describe the treatments between Materials and
			Data in an experiment (i.e. the Nodes of the experiment graph). An
			Edge can be annotated with ProtocolApplications; there can be many
			edges sharing the same protocolapplication. It has no explicit
			equivalent in the MAGE-TAB format specification but acts as a
			container for chain of zero-or-more ProtocolApplications that can be
			added, e.g. between Source, Sample, Assay, etc. See example,

			<comment>
				Assay is a node used to represent the result of an experiment e.g.
				an Array or other platform which after processing produce data.
				Assay replaces Hybridization from MAGE-TAB version 1.0. When Assay
				is used an ontology term describing the technology must be provided.
				If an array based experiment is described then the association to
				ArrayDesign is used. We have chosen not to model Hybridization as a
				sub class of Assay in this model as it has fewer associations and
				use of Assay makes the model more generic. Assay has associations to
				various data files. If there are multiple scanning events generating
				data files consider using Scan to represent these. See example
				ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/experiment/TABM/E-TABM-506/E-TABM-506.sdrf.txt.
				There is no direct FuGE equivalent.
				<br />
				The closest map is likely FuGE:ProtocolApplication. ** Needs
				checking with FuGE docs
