	<description>
		This is a small MOLGENIS app for the software development process
		called SCRUM. Also it includes several technical tricks worth
		mentioning:
		<ul>
			<li>A design pattern for versioning (of Tasks)</li>
			<li>Use of HTML5 drop-and-drop (of yellow sticky notes on the
				whiteboard)</li>
			<li>Use of HTML5 graphics canvas (to render the burndown chart)</li>
			<li>Use of the java.util.Calendar API (to produce example data)</li>
		</ul>
		Next to that also steps where made to enable modularity:
		<ul>
			<li>this project contains now a gcc.jar which it reuses.</li>
			<li>the plugin generators now check if the plugin already exists on
				classpath. Result is that MOLGENIS will not generate empty plugin
				boilerplate in handwritten/java and you than have to copy your
				plugin code into that. Instead you can include the plugin from your
				other project as *.jar.</li>
			<li>
				the *.properties, *_db.xml and *_ui.xml can now be loaded from class
				path (instead of local file system). This means MOLGENIS now can
				load auth.xml from 'shared' inside the gcc.jar instead of needing to
				copying the file (with all problems to keep that synchronous). Also
				it makes it easier to move code between projects when refactoring.
				<em>WE NEED TO MAKE THIS PATH BETTER THAN 'shared'</em>
			</li>
