			Generic schema inspired by Chado. All other properties should already
			be covered in the core Pheno.xml model, in particular relationship
			which is in ObservedValue. Some extra may need to be added (e.g.
			dbXrefs, pubs, etc, for each ObservationElement).
			<br />
			There is a crucial difference between the Chado location model and
			the sequence location model used in other schemas, such as GFF,
			GenBank, BioSQL, or BioPerl. First, Chado is the only model to use
			the concept of rank and locgroup. Second, and perhaps more important,
			all these other models allow discontiguous locations (also known as
			"split locations").See

			<!-- renamed from SeqFeature -->
			<description>A feature is a biological sequence or a section of a
				biological sequence, or a collection of such sections. Examples
				include genes, exons, transcripts, regulatory regions, polypeptides,
				protein domains, chromosome sequences, sequence variations,
				cross-genome match regions such as hits and HSPs and so on; see the
				Sequence Ontology for more.

			<field name="label" nillable="true"
				description="The name of SequenceFeature is unique. Label allows for human-readable name that is potentially not unique." />
			<field name="featureType" type="xref" xref_entity="OntologyTerm"
				nillable="true"
				description="A required reference to a ontologyTerm giving the feature type. E.g. chromosome, contig, exon, snp, etc. This will typically be a Sequence Ontology identifier. This column is thus used to subclass the feature table. " />
			<field name="species" type="xref" xref_entity="Species"
				nillable="true"
				description="The organism to which this feature belongs. This column is mandatory." />
			<field name="residues" type="text" nillable="true"
				description="A sequence of alphabetic characters representing biological residues (nucleic acids, amino acids). This column does not need to be manifested for all features; it is optional for features such as exons where the residues can be derived from the featureloc. It is recommended that the value for this column be manifested for features which may may non-contiguous sublocations (e.g. transcripts), since derivation at query time is non-trivial. For expressed sequence, the DNA sequence should be used rather than the RNA sequence." />
			<field name="seqlen" type="int" nillable="true"
				description="The length of the residue feature. See column:residues. This column is partially redundant with the residues column, and also with featureloc. This column is required because the location may be unknown and the residue sequence may not be manifested, yet it may be desirable to store and query the length of the feature. The seqlen should always be manifested where the length of the sequence is known." />

		<entity name="SequenceRelation" implements="Identifiable">
			<description>
				Relation of one feature relative to another. If
				appropriate feature
				loc(ation) information can be. One can have multiple of these
				relations/locations, e.g. relative to
				different strains or to
				different featureType (e.g. SNP relative to
				gene, exon, chromsome,
				etc). Any feature can have zero or more relations.

				Discussion: should this be an Observation or an ObservationElement?

			<field name="Target" type="xref" xref_entity="SequenceCharacteristic"
				description="(Overrides Observation.target) The source feature which this location is relative to. Every location is relative to another feature (however, this column is nullable, because the srcfeature may not be known). All locations are -proper- that is, nothing should be located relative to itself. No cycles are allowed in the featureloc graph." />
			<field name="relationType" type="xref" xref_entity="OntologyTerm"
				nillable="true"
				description="Relationship type between feature and sourcefeature. This is a ontology term typically from the OBO relationship ontology, although other relationship types are allowed. The most common relationship type is OBO_REL:part_of. Valid relationship types are constrained by the Sequence Ontology." />
			<field name="rank" type="int" nillable="true"
				description="The ordering of subject features with respect to the object feature may be important (for example, exon ordering on a transcript - not always derivable if you take trans spliced genes into consideration). Rank is used to order these; starts from zero. Some features (e.g. blast hits and HSPs) have two locations - one on the query and one on the subject. Rank is used to differentiate these. Rank=0 is always used for the query, Rank=1 for the subject. For multiple alignments, assignment of rank is arbitrary. Rank is also used for sequence_variant features, such as SNPs. Rank=0 indicates the wildtype (or baseline) feature, Rank=1 indicates the mutant (or compared) feature." />
			<field name="fmin" type="int" nillable="true"
				description="The leftmost/minimal boundary in the linear range represented by the featureloc. Sometimes (e.g. in Bioperl) this is called -start- although this is confusing because it does not necessarily represent the 5-prime coordinate. Important: This is space-based (interbase) coordinates, counting from zero. To convert this to the leftmost position in a base-oriented system (eg GFF, Bioperl), add 1 to fmin." />
			<field name="is_fmin_partial" type="bool" nillable="true"

			<field name="fmax" type="int" nillable="true"
				description="The rightmost/maximal boundary in the linear range represented by the featureloc. Sometimes (e.g. in bioperl) this is called -end- although this is confusing because it does not necessarily represent the 3-prime coordinate. Important: This is space-based (interbase) coordinates, counting from zero. No conversion is required to go from fmax to the rightmost coordinate in a base-oriented system that counts from 1 (e.g. GFF, Bioperl)." />

				nillable="true"
				description="Phase of translation with respect to srcfeature_id. Values are 0, 1, 2. It may not be possible to manifest this column for some features such as exons, because the phase is dependant on the spliceform (the same exon can appear in multiple spliceforms). This column is mostly useful for predicted exons and CDSs." />
			<field name="residue_info" type="text" nillable="true"
				description="Alternative residues, when these differ from feature.residues. For instance, a SNP feature located on a wild and mutant protein would have different alternative residues. for alignment/similarity features, the alternative residues is used to represent the alignment string (CIGAR format). Note on variation features; even if we do not want to instantiate a mutant chromosome/contig feature, we can still represent a SNP etc with 2 locations, one (rank 0) on the genome, the other (rank 1) would have most fields null, except for alternative residues." />
