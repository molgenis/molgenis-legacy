		<description>
			Observ-OM is a model to uniformly describe any phenotypic, genotypic
			or
			molecular observation. The five core concepts are:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>ObservationTarget:</b>
					the object we are observing.
					<br />
					For example: an Individual,
					a Panel/Strain, a Sample, a Gene, a
					Marker.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>ObservableFeature:</b>
					the question asked or characteristic being
					oberveded.
					<br />
					For example: 'What is height of [Target]?', 'What is genotype of
					[Target] at
					[Marker]?', 'Has [Target] ever used medicine [X]', 'What
					is QTL p-value
					association of [Marker] with [Gene Expression]?
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Protocol:</b>
					the procedure of observation
					<br />
					For example: Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), R/QTL mapping
					method,
					Genotype array, GWAS protocol.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>ProtocolApplication:</b>
					the actual act of observation. For example:
					'FFQ asked to
					[Individual:individual1], 'R/QTL applied to
					[Marker:pvv4]',
					'Genotype array applied to [Panel:Mouse RIL BxD 1]
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>ObservedValue:</b>
					the values for each feature observed, grouped per
					ProtocolApplication(and thereby target)
				</li>
			</ul>

		<entity name="ObservableFeature" implements="Identifiable">
			<description>
				ObservableFeature defines anything that can be observed
				in a
				phenotypic Investigation.
				<p />
				In other words, ObservableFeature are the
				questions asked, e.g. 'What
				is Height?', 'What is Systolic blood
				pressure?', or 'Has blue eyes?'.
				<p />
				Some questions may
				be repeated for multiple characteristics. For
				example 'What is [MarkerAllele]
				observed?' can be applied to all
				elements of a Marker set, and 'What
				is [medicin codes] uses' can be
				applied to a set of Medicine codes. This can be specified using the
				measuredCharacteristic field. (Discussion: how exactly?)
				<p />
				The identifier of ObservableFeature is
				unique
				. It is recommended that
				each
				ObservableFeature is named
				according to a well-defined ontology
				term
				which can be specified via
				ontologyReference. The
				ObservableFeature
				class maps to XGAP:Trait,
				METABASE:Question,
				FuGE:DimensionElement,
				and PaGE:ObservableFeature.
				Multi-value
				features can be grouped by
				Protocol. For instance: high
				blood pressure
				can be inferred from
				observations for features
				systolic and diastolic
				blood pressure.
				There may be many alternative
				protocols to measure a
				feature. See
				Protocol section.

				observation. Typical examples are 'Individual' or 'Panel'. But also
				'Marker' can be an Target when asked the question 'QTL p-value for
				[phenotype]': here both target and feature are characteristic, for

			<description>
				The Protocol class defines parameterizable descriptions of
				(analysis)methods;
				each protocol has a unique identifier. The usage
				of a protocol is called 'ProtocolApplication', which is the
				application of a protocol to one target (this typically translates
				to a data row in a table).Examples of
				protocols are: SOP for blood
				pressure measurement used
				by UK biobank,
				or 'R/qtl' as protocol for
				statistical analysis.
				Protocol is a high
				level object that represents
				the details of
				protocols used during the
				investigation. Protocol has
				an association to
				OntologyTerm to
				represent the type of protocol.
				<br />
				The FUGE equivalent to Protocol is FuGE::Protocol.
				<br />
				The Protocol class maps to FuGE/XGAP/MageTab Protocol, but in
				contrast to FuGE it is not required to extend protocol before use.
				The Protocol class also maps to METABASE:Form (note that components
				are solved during METABASE:Visit which can be nested). Has no
				equivalent in PaGE.

				A ProtocolApplication class defines the actual action of observation

				The ProtocolApplication class maps to FuGE/XGAP ProtocolApplication,

		<entity name="Observation" abstract="true">
			<description>
				Generic model for observations, that is, the observed value on a
				feature-target pair given a protocol. See the 'data' package for all
				kinds of observations. Typically, this data is visualized in a
				spreadsheet format having rows (targets) and columns (features). Use
				cases that need support are:
				<ul>
					<li>Simple text/int values, e.g. 'length in cm (row;
						observableFeature) of individual1 (col; observationTarget) = 179
						(value). These can be stored in subclass 'ObservedValue'
					</li>
					<li>Relationship values, e.g. 'individual 1(row:observationtarget)
						and individual2 (col:observationtarget) = brothers
						(value:observabvlefeature). These can be stored in subclass
						'ObservedValue'
					</li>
					<li>Categoryd values, e.g. 'invidual 1 (row) and feature 'sex'
						(col) = 'male' (value; reference to code or ontology. These can be
						stored in subclass 'ObservedValue'
					</li>
					<li>Data file values, e.g., 'aligned.bam' or 'plink imputed'
						(feature). These can be stored in subclass DataFile
					</li>
					<li>Data matrices, e.g. 'qtlProfile' (feature) for 'bxd panel'
						(target). These can be stored in subclass ObservedData
					</li>
					<li>Measurements are typically grouped by the protocol used,
						therefore a link to protocol application is added.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Implementation wise, the data may or may not be stored in the
				database directly. This is an optimization strategy independent of
				this generic structure. This structure is born out of the merger of
				Pheno-OM, XGAP and MAGE-TAB.<!-- The original documentation: <br /> Generic 
					data structure for aiming the values of a data set as described in Data. 
					Each DataElement describes a cell in a data matrix of rows (from) and columns 
					(to), e.g., in "dataset X" it was measured that geneX (col) relates to geneZ 
					(row). <br /> MAGE-TAB 1.1. has the column ArrayDataMatrix and DerivedArrayDataMatrix. 
					The formats of both types are tab-delimited and the distinction is that an 
					ArrayDataMatrix is raw data and the DerivedArrayDataMatrix is processed data. 
					The DerivedArrayDataMatrix associates a file of a specific format - see the 
					MAGE-TAB specification for details. In order to index the Rows and Columns 
					of DataMatrix we have generated a DimensionElement that allows us to index 
					DimensionRow and DimensionColumn. -->
