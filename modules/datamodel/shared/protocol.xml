		<description>This package is a merger of FUGE, XGAP, MAGE-TAB and
			Pheno-OM classes dealing with protocols. Discussion: are protocols
			study specific, i.e., are they InvestigationElements?
		</description>
		<entity name="Protocol" implements="InvestigationElement">
			<description>
				The Protocol class defines parameterizable descriptions of methods;
				each protocol has a unique name within an Study. Each
				ProtocolApplication can define the ObservableFeatures it can
				observe. Also the protocol parameters can be modeled using
				ObservableFeatures (Users are expected to 'tag' the observeable
				feature by setting ObserveableFeature type as 'ProtocolParameter'.
				Examples of protocols are: SOP for blood pressure measurement used
				by UK biobank, or 'R/qtl' as protocol for statistical analysis.
				Protocol is a high level object that represents the details of
				protocols used during the investigation. The uses of Protocols to
				process BioMaterials and Data are referenced by ProtocolApplication
				(in the SDRF part of the format). Protocol has an association to
				OntologyTerm to represent the type of protocol. Protocols are
				associated with Hardware, Software and Parameters used in the
				Protocol. An example from ArrayExpress is E-MTAB-506

				The FUGE equivalent to Protocol is FuGE::Protocol.
				<br />
				The Protocol class maps to FuGE/XGAP/MageTab Protocol, but in
				contrast to FuGE it is not required to extend protocol before use.
				The Protocol class also maps to METABASE:Form (note that components
				are solved during METABASE:Visit which can be nested). Has no
				equivalent in PaGE.

		<entity name="ProtocolApplication" implements="InvestigationElement">
			<description>
				A ProtocolApplication class defines the actual action of observation
				by refering to a protocol and optional ParameterValues. The name
				field can be used to label applications with a human understandeable
				tag. For example: the action of blood pressure measurement on 1000
				individuals, using a particular protocol, resulting in 1000
				associated observed values. If desired, protocols can be shared
				between Studys; in those cases one should simply refer to a protocol
				in another Study.
				<br />
				ProtocolApplications are used in MAGE-TAB format to reference to
				protocols used, with optionally use of certain protocol parameter
				values. For example, a Source may be transformed into a Labeled
				Extract by the subsequent application of a Extraction and Labeling
				protocol. ProtocolApplication is associated with and Edge that links
				input/output, e.g. Source to Labeled Extract. The order of the
				application of protocols can be set in order to be able to
				reconstruct the left-to-right order of protocol references in
				MAGE-TAB format. The FuGE equivalent to ProtocolApplication is
				FuGE:ProtocolApplication, however input/output is modeled using
				Edge.
				<br />
				The ProtocolApplication class maps to FuGE/XGAP ProtocolApplication,
				but in FuGE ProtocolApplications can take Material or Data (or both)
				as input and produce Material or Data (or both) as output. Similar
				to PaGE.ObservationMethod. Maps to METABASE:Visit (also note that
				METABASE:PlannedVisit allows for planning of protocol applications;
				this is outside scope for this model?).

		<!-- DISCUSSION: we added ComputeFeature, ComputeElement and ComputeValue 
			for understandability. But I think we don't need them (and actually we are 
			better off without: we don't care about ComputeFeature as we want to be able 
			to use any feature; we don't care about ComputeValue as we want any ObservedValue, 
			and ComputeElement is just as WorkflowElement. Possibly we want ComputeWorkflow 
			so we can validate if all elements are ComputeProtocols). Proposal, move
