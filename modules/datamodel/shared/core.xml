		<entity name="OntologyTerm" xref_label="name" implements="Nameable">
			<description>
				OntologyTerm defines a single entry (term) from an ontology or a
				controlled vocabulary (defined by Ontology). The name is the
				ontology term which is unique within an ontology source, such as
				[examples here]. Other data entities can reference to this
				OntologyTerm to harmonize naming of concepts. Each term should have
				a local, unique label within the Investigation. If no suitable
				ontology term exists then one can define new terms locally (in which
				case there is no formal accession for the term limiting its use for
				cross-Investigation queries). In those cases the local name should
				be repeated in both term and termAccession. Maps to
				FuGE::OntologyIndividual; in MAGE-TAB there is no separate entity to
				model terms.
				<br />
				Optionally a local controlled vocabulary or ontology can be defined,
				for example to represent 'Codelists' often used in questionaires.
				Note: this is not a InvestigationElement because of the additional
				xref_label and unique constraint.This class defines a single entry
				from an ontology or a controlled vocabulary.
				<br />
				If it is a simple controlled vocabulary, there may be no formal
				accession for the term. In these cases the local name should be
				repeated in both term and termAccession. If the term has a value,
				the OntologyTerm will have a single DataProperty whose value was the
				value for the property. For instance, for an OntologyIndividual
				based on the MO ontology the attributes might be: The term would be
				what is usually called the local name in the Ontology, for instance
				'Age'; The termAccession could be
				'http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/MGEDOntology.owl#Age' or a
				an arbitrary accession if one exists; The identifier is a unique
				identifier for individuals in the scope of the FuGE instance; The
				inherited name attribute should not be used; The ontologyURI of
				OntologySource could be
				'http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/MGEDOntology.owl&quot;. The
				OntologyTerm subclasses are instances of Ontology classes and
				properties, not the actual terms themselves. An OntologyIndividual,
				if based on an existing Ontology, can be considered a statement that
				can be validated against the referenced ontology. The subclasses and
				their associations are based on the Ontology Definition Model,

				Publication is part of the Investigation package and is used to
				represent information about one or more publications related to an

				information- though this use is less common. Publications have
				attributes of publications Authors and also DOI and Pubmed
				identifiers (when these are available). These are represented as
				OntologyTerms as in the MAGE-TAB model all 'xrefs' (cross
				references) for ontologies and accession numbers are handled
				generically. An example of a publication is available in an IDF file
				from ArrayExpress is experiment E-MTAB-506
