			<description>
				A single entry from an ontology or a controlled vocabulary. If it is
				a simple controlled vocabulary, there may be no formal accession for
				the term. In these cases the local name should be repeated in both
				term and termAccession. If the term has a value, the
				OntologyIndividual will have a single DataProperty whose value was
				the value for the property. For instance, for an OntologyIndividual
				based on the MO ontology the attributes might be: The term would be
				what is usually called the local name in the Ontology, for instance
				'Age'; The termAccession could be
				'http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/MGEDOntology.owl#Age' or a
				an arbitrary accession if one exists; The identifier is a unique
				identifier for individuals in the scope of the FuGE instance; The
				inherited name attribute should not be used; The ontologyURI of
				OntologySource could be
				'http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/MGEDOntology.owl&quot;.
				The
				OntologyTerm subclasses are instances of Ontology
				classes and
				properties, not the actual terms themselves.
				An OntologyIndividual,
				if based on an existing Ontology,
				can be considered a statement that
				can be validated
				against the referenced ontology. The subclasses and
				their associations are based on the Ontology Definition
				Model,
